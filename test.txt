Q1. What are the primitive data types in JavaScript? List all of them with one example each.
    The primitive datatypes are the store the values of number, string  etc.
    list of primitive datatypes
    Number, string, boolean , null ,undefine etc ..

    let a = 10,
    let str = "Mohit"
    let bool = true or false 
    let value = null
    let undefineValues = 

Q2 Explain the difference between null and undefined with examples.
    Null is use to variable value to be null .
    undefine is use to the to the value not a define to the value

Q3. What will be the output of typeof NaN and why?
    the type of NaN a value to define to the Not a Null to the define 

Q4. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? When should you use each?    
    == it will be check the only the value
    === it will be check the value and his datatype

Q5. Explain the difference between if-else and switch statements. When would you prefer one over the other?
    the if-else case statements it used to the check the condition and run to particular output and
    else will be run after the the if also false 

Q6. What is a ternary operator? Write its syntax and explain with an example.
    ternary opreator means the condition will be check and result will be true or false

    syntax :    condition ? true : false

Q7. What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript? List at least 5 falsy values.
    truthy values will be always return a values of true .
    falsy value will  be always return a values of false .

    total five falsy values :-  1.
                                2.
                                3.
                                4.
                                5.

Q8. Can we use multiple conditions in a single if statement? Explain with the help of logical operators (&&, ||, !).
    && logical and opreator use to the condition and condition will be two and also check the condition will be check
    the condition will be true.

    || or operator use the  condition will be check the one condition will be true then output will be print .

    ! not oprator will be use to the output will be replace true = false and false = true .


Q9. What is the difference between for, while, and do-while loops? When would you use each?   
    for loop will be check condition start and end will be apply .
    while loop will be the first the check the condition will after run the logic . 
    do-while loop use the also first at least will be run one time the after will be check the condition .

Q10. Explain what an infinite loop is and how can it be avoided.
    The infinite loop is always logic are true 
    example:- let i = 0;
                while(i<0){
                    console.log("........logic........",i)
                }   

Q11. What is the purpose of break and continue statements in loops? Give one example of each.
    break -> key word use to the condition will be stop . 
    contionue -> key word use to the condition it will be true then this output to be not to the print then loop will be continue 
    run

Q12. How does a for...of loop differ from a for...in loop?
    for..of loop will be return the index values.
    for.in loop will be return the key to the object .

Q13. Explain the difference between map() and forEach(). When would you use one over the other?
    map() function to the use to the all array values to any opration to be perform all the array element .
    forEach() method to used to the retuen the all array element .

Q14. What is the difference between filter() and find() methods?
    filter() -> will be return the multiple values to set the condition .
    find() -> check the condition and find the first values to the array .

Q15. How does reduce() work? Explain with a simple example.
    syntax :- let str = str.reduce((lrv,ele,i ) => {
        console.log("",str)
        return "text" 
    })
    reduce work the first it will be by default(last return value) index will be gether to the lrv.
    second parameter to the element.
    third parameter to the index value .

Q16. What is the difference between push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() methods?
    push() -> it is use to the add the values to array in last .
    pop() -> it will be delete the element to the array in the last .
    shift() -> delete element in the array of starting .
    unshift () -> add the element array to the starting .

Q17. Explain any 5 string methods with their use cases.
    1.str.length
        Give all string length

    2.uppercase
        convert string in upper case
    
    3.lower case
        convert the tring in lower case

    4.split
        convert the string to the array .

    5. 

Q18. What is the difference between slice() and substring() in strings?
    
    slice -> return the element to the string 
    syntax : let str = str.slice(2 , 6)

    substring ->it will be give the output the same .
    syntax : let str = str.substring(2 , 6)

Q19. How do you access properties of an object? Explain dot notation vs bracket notation.
        1 -> . notation object name.key name 
        2 -> [] [objectname][name of property]     

Q20. How can you loop through all keys and values of an object?



Q21. Write a program to check if a number is even or odd.

    let a = 10

    if(a%2==0){
        console.log("even number)
    }
    else
    {
        console.log("odd number")
    }

Q22. Write a program to find the largest number among three given numbers.

    let a= 10
    let b = 20 
    let c = 30

    if(a > b && a >c){
        console.log("a is gretest")
    }else if(b > a && b > c){
         console.log("b is gretest")
    }else{
         console.log("c is gretest")
    }

Q23. Write a program to reverse a string without using the reverse() method.
    let str = "hii"
    let final = str.split("")
        console.log("convert the array",final)
    for(let i=str.length; i>=0; i--)
        {
            console.log("reverse values",final)
        }

Q24. Write a program to count the number of vowels in a given string.    
    let str = "Mohit"
